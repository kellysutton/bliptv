= Blip.tv Ruby Library

A Ruby gem for accessing the blip.tv API (http://wiki.blip.tv/index.php/REST_Upload_API)

== Install

  gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
  sudo gem install kellysutton-bliptv
  sudo gem install rest-client
  sudo gem install mime-types

== Usage

While the blip.tv API is extremely simple to use, sometimes it's nice to have a wrapper
library to make life even easier. The BlipTV Ruby gem is just that.

Let's say you want to upload a video:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'bliptv'

  client = BlipTV::Base.new

  options = {
    :username => "barack_obama",
    :password => "michellexoxo",
    :file => File.open('movie.mov'),
    :title => "Ordering Hamburgers in DC",
    :description => "I love this one burger joint, but the press keeps following me."
  }

  video = client.upload_video(options) #=> BlipTV::Video

The upload_video method call returns a BlipTV::Video object
that you can play around with.

Or what if you wanted a list of all videos by a user? Also easy:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'bliptv'

  client = BlipTV::Base.new

  video_list = client.find_all_videos_by_user("barack_obama")

find_all_videos_by_user will return a list of BlipTV::Video objects.

More usage coming soon.

== Features

Provides an easy way to interact with the blip.tv API in Ruby.

== Special Thanks

This gem is extensively based on Shane Vitrana's Viddler
gem as well as the YouTubeG gem. Much of the code was simply
copied and then tweaked to fit the blip.tv nomenclature
of certain calls.
